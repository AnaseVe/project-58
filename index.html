                                I love to code because it lets my creativity flow
                                it also is very fun and esay to do.Threw coding I know I can make a huge difference in the world around me.
                                From countless posibilities and applications, this is one of the best ways to express my creativity.
                                Another reason I love it is because I get involved with problem solving by creating solutions to community problems.
                            <h1> How it benifits others </h1>
                            Not all children are into sports, music and other mainstream interests. You can make friends with like-minded people, other children who enjoy being creative, building technology, solving problems and being innovative.
                            It is not easy being a child who does not quite fit into traditional schooling. Coding offers something different. It’s a creative and analytical hobby that provides a very different experience for children. It’s great to find a hobby to connect with and truly love and enjoy.<br><br>

                            As you can see, coding offers more than just writing lines of code. There are many benefits of coding that have nothing to do with coding.<br><br>
                            Creativity, problem solving, learning and building things is not easy. Students often need to spend time and effort to puzzle out problem. However, in the end, when they solve the problem, they get to feel a sense of achievement, the greater the problem the greater the joy. These are really valuable benefits of coding that have nothing to do with coding.Students get the opportunity of building projects together. Students get the opportunity of building projects together. When coding many people experience project management, communicating in a team, compromise, discussion, and negotiation with others.Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.Logic is a skill students can practice through code. Through dissecting existing programs to understand the process and flow to achieve the solution through written code, students become increasingly analytical. Whether they are building or debugging, they are exercising their logic faculties on a regular basis. Understanding machine operations, conditionals, and progression in coding projects strengthens logic. Being able to break down issues into small, separate parts and figure out how each is affecting the other will help students think in a systematic and objective way, rather than relying on solving problems emotionally.<br>
                            Coding brings out enterprising qualities in students. Coding is not like other subjects in school where the facts might be all in the classroom with them. When beginning the journey of code, students will find themselves quickly identifying gaps in their learning and recognise the need to seek resources for themselves. This search for an answer will accustom students to find and recognise the quality or reliability of sources to achieve and fulfill their creative ideas.<br> <br>
                            Abstract thinking is the ability to think about objects, principles, and ideas that are not physically present, for example the use of analogies. Once students begin to learn languages like JavaScript or Python that are not immediately visualized, students will need to practice speculating and predicting results in how the interrelationships of the code happen as a whole.<br> Some scholars argue that abstract thinking is not a natural cognitive development, but rather a development through culture, teaching and experience. Support students to develop their ability to make connections and abstraction in intermediate and advanced coding through unplugged activities and the utilization of graphic organizers, such as flowcharts.<br> <br>
                            Coding is great practice for attention to detail. Not only from the perspective of the accuracy of the code itself, but also accounting for users’ needs; for example ensuring a well designed user interface and experience. A savvy coder may develop a system to avoid repeated mistakes. Where errors are present, they will examine their work systematically. Experienced software developers often try to “break” programs to identify problems and areas of improvement before launching a product to the market. This iterative and creative process can be applied in your classroom as well. Get students to demo and test each others’ creations and see what they pick up on.
